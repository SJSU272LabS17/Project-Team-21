# Introduction

Digital assistant for customer support provides a single platform for customers to easily connect with organizations. It sends immediate responses to address any issue that a customer has. The digital assistant is trained to respond to the key issues using IBM Watson. It is trained to raise tickets for every new issue that Watson doesn’t recognize. Also, the digital assistant can monitor the issues and prioritize issues based on number of issues in a category. This helps organization to keep track of issues based on categories.
